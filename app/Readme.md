## Model Deployment

### This Deployment folder creates an application, containerized with a Docker Image that is uploaded to AWS ECR. The Image can be executed to either train and save the model or deploy the trained model as a Real-Time or Batch AWS Endpoint. The endpoint serves the trained model and can receive inference requests which are handled by an API.
